### A 2D Drawing Interface

This project was created as part of the Google Developer Group and developed over the span of a semester. With a team size of 12 members - many of us new to programming - this project was a learning experience.

The primary motivation behind our project was to learn. We wanted to push ourselves outside of our comfort zone, and create a functionable and marketable product from scratch. 

We developed the project in C++, using SFML for graphics, and integrating APIs with cURL and Nlohmann-json. Our project was structured around and built in CMake. 

---

Since our project had many different components, we divided it into four main roles. Each member could take multiple roles.
1. **Core Features**: Implementing the fundamental functionalities that our program was built around, like the pen, eraser, and maintaining the overall project structure for scalability and readability. 
2. **Shapes and Tools**: Creating and refining features such as undo/redo functionality, save, fill and color tools, shapes, and integrating AI features.
3. **UI/UX**: Designing and creating elements like the start screen, toolbar, and dropdown menu, as well as maintaining communication between the interface and the canvas.
4. **Web Development**: Creating and building a website to showcase our product, as well as deciding on a stylistic approach for our project.
